# Family To-Do List project feonted

**Family To-Do List** is a clean, minimal, and user-friendly task management web application built with modern React + TypeScript to-do list app featuring Zustand for state management, AuthGuard-like login simulation, localStorage persistence, and dynamic task detail pages.

This project is designed as a foundation for a fully functional mobile and desktop app, with the long-term goal of publishing it to the **App Store**. It demonstrates a solid understanding of component-based architecture, local data persistence, and interactive UI development in modern front-end technologies.
